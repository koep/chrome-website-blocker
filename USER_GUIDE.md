# Pomodoro Timer - Quick Start Guide

## What is This?

Your website blocker now includes a built-in Pomodoro timer! Instead of just showing a motivational quote when you visit a blocked site, you'll see an active timer that helps you maintain focus through structured work sessions.

## How to Use

### 1. Start a Focus Session

1. Visit any blocked website
2. You'll see the blocked page with a timer showing **25:00**
3. Click the **Start** button to begin your work session
4. The timer will count down from 25 minutes

### 2. During Your Work Session

- The page displays **"Work Session"** at the top
- Timer counts down every second: 25:00 → 24:59 → 24:58...
- **Pause** button appears if you need a quick break
- **Reset** button is always available to start over

### 3. Taking a Break

- When your 25-minute work session completes, the timer automatically switches to **"Break Time"**
- You get a 5-minute break
- The page shows this with a green indicator
- Blocked sites remain blocked during breaks (to help you truly rest!)

### 4. After Your Break

- When the 5-minute break ends, a new 25-minute work session automatically begins
- The cycle continues: Work (25min) → Break (5min) → Work (25min)...
- You can pause or reset at any time

## Buttons Explained

### ▶ Start Button
- **When to use**: When timer shows "Ready to Focus" or is paused
- **What it does**: Starts or resumes the timer

### ⏸ Pause Button
- **When to use**: During an active work session or break
- **What it does**: Pauses the timer (you can resume later)

### ↻ Reset Button
- **When to use**: Any time you want to start fresh
- **What it does**: Stops the timer and returns to "Ready to Focus" (25:00)

## Tips

### 🎯 Stay Focused
- Try to complete full 25-minute sessions without pausing
- Use the break time to rest your eyes and stretch

### 🔄 Natural Rhythm
- Let the timer cycle naturally (work → break → work)
- The automatic transitions help maintain momentum

### 📱 Multiple Tabs
- If you open multiple blocked sites, they all show the same timer
- Changes in one tab sync to all others instantly

### 🌓 Dark Mode
- The timer automatically adapts to your system's light/dark mode preference
- All colors remain readable in both modes

## What Happens When...

### ❓ I close my browser?
The timer resets. When you reopen and visit a blocked site, you'll see a fresh 25:00 timer.

### ❓ I accidentally close the tab?
No problem! Open any blocked site again and the timer will still be running (synced across all tabs).

### ❓ The timer reaches 0:00?
It automatically transitions to the next phase (work → break or break → work).

### ❓ I want to stop completely?
Click the **Reset** button to return to the starting state.
